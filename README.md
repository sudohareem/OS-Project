Ice Cream Parlor Management System

This project is a multithreaded simulation in a system call implementation of an ice cream parlor, designed to handle customer orders efficiently while managing limited resources like ice cream sizes, flavors, toppings, and serving choices. It uses semaphores for synchronization to avoid race conditions and ensures proper allocation of shared resources.

Features include:

Dynamic customer order processing.
Support for multiple concurrent customer threads.
Synchronization using semaphores for resource management.
Real-time simulation of ice cream preparation and delivery.
Revenue tracking and order invoicing.

This system demonstrates the application of threading, synchronization, and critical section handling in a practical scenario. Perfect for learning resource management and concurrency in C programming.
